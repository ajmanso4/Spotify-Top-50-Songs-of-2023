^^ As we can see here, Ed Sheeran is the artist with the most songs in the top 50 of Spotify 2023, with 4 songs. In second place lies Post Malone and The Weeknd, with 3 songs each.

<br>

We can see the top 25 and the top 10 as we zoom in closer:
<img width="886" height="800" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-16 at 18 03 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6d73539-b50b-48d8-b252-bac546a56c9e" />

Some basic statistics of the dataset:
* Mean: 2,357,434,145
* Standard deviation: 404,438,639
* Minimum: 1,930,339,344
* Maximum: 3,783,983,806

^^ As we can see here, the songs "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran and B"linding Lights" by The Weeknd are clear outliers when it comes to total streams.

<br>
<br>

#### 2. Which artists have the highest streams per song? One-Hit-Wonder metric!
<img width="1090" height="596" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-16 at 22 16 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586e2e73-4611-475b-bea1-649a3c9b8106" />

^^ As we can see, this is a pretty good metric for one hit wonders as we see "Someone You Loved" by Lewis Capaldi, "Dance Monkey" by Tones And I, "STAY" by The Kid Laroi, and "Heat Waves" by Glass Animals on the top of this list. The majority of people on Earth would be able to recognize those songs but the chance the average person could name other songs by them is lower than artists like Dua Lipa or The Weeknd. These are prime examples of "One hit wonder" artists.

Naturally, we see artists on this "One hit wonder" list who are most definitley not one hit wonders such as The Weeknd and Post Malone. Both of them are extreme outliers, as not many artists are able to get billions of streams on more than two songs.

<br>
<br>

#### 3. Within the top 50, do artists with more entries account for more listening volume?
<img width="811" height="601" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-16 at 22 06 47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de04cf3e-a86d-46b7-96a4-0b5db428f8bb" />

^^ This visualization confirms the relationship between the number of songs an artist has in Spotify's top 50 and their total amount of streams. This is another way to visualize the significant gap between Ed Sheeran, The Weeknd and Post Malone compared to the other artists.
